You're asked to build a mini version of the grep command. Your script will be called mygrep.sh and must support:
Ì¥π Basic Functionality
‚Ä¢ Search for a string (case-insensitive)
‚Ä¢ Print matching lines from a text file
Ì¥π Command-Line Options:
‚Ä¢ -n ‚Üí Show line numbers for each match
‚Ä¢ -v ‚Üí Invert the match (print lines that do not match)
‚Ä¢ Combinations like -vn, -nv should work the same as using -v -n
  
Ìª†Ô∏è Technical Requirements:
1.  The script must be executable and accept input as:
2.  It must handle invalid input (e.g., missing file, too few arguments).
3.  Output must mimic grep's style as closely as possible.
  
Ì∑™ Hands-On Validation: You must test your script with the file testfile.txt containing the following:
Hello world
This is a test
another test line
HELLO AGAIN
Don't match this line
Testing one two three
‚úÖ Include:
‚Ä¢ Screenshot of your terminal running the script with: 
    ‚ó¶ ./mygrep.sh hello testfile.txt
    ‚ó¶ ./mygrep.sh -n hello testfile.txt
    ‚ó¶ ./mygrep.sh -vn hello testfile.txt
    ‚ó¶ ./mygrep.sh -v testfile.txt (expect: script should warn about missing search string)
  
Ì∑† Reflective Section
In your submission, include:
1.  A breakdown of how your script handles arguments and options.
2.  A short paragraph: If you were to support regex or -i/-c/-l options, how would your structure change?
3.  What part of the script was hardest to implement and why?
  
ÌøÜ Bonus:
‚Ä¢ Add support for --help flag to print usage info.
‚Ä¢ Improve option parsing using getopts.
